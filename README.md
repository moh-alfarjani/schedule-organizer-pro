## üöÄ Project Overview
**Schedule Organizer Pro** is designed to let students and staff create, view, edit and manage weekly lectures or events without any server ‚Äî everything runs in the browser and persists to `localStorage`. The app focuses on clarity and speed: a vertical list of days, horizontal scrollable lecture cards per day, quick add/edit modals, filters, search, and a floating action button (FAB) for common operations.

Key user capabilities:
- Create, view, edit and delete lectures (full CRUD) via modals.
- Persistent state using `localStorage` so schedules remain between sessions.
- Import and export schedules as JSON backups (with confirmation dialogs).
- Real-time search, day/subject filters and autocomplete suggestions when filling forms.
- Dark / light theme toggle and quick language switch (English ‚áÑ Arabic).

## üìÖ Development Plan (As Implemented)
| Day | Focus                      | Outcome |
|-----|----------------------------|---------|
| 1   | Project scaffold & wireframe | `index.html`, `style.css` and basic grid created. |
| 2   | Core layout                 | Responsive day rows + horizontal lecture containers. |
| 3   | CRUD & Modals               | Add / View / Edit modal flows implemented in `main.js`. |
| 4   | State & Persistence         | Central `state` object + `localStorage` sync and normalisation. |
| 5   | i18n & Theming              | English/Arabic translations and theme variables (CSS). |
| 6   | Extras                      | Import/Export, FAB, autocomplete, countdown timers. |
| 7   | Testing & polish            | Accessibility tweaks, focus handling, keyboard-friendly forms. |

### Core
- **Full CRUD** for lectures: add new lecture cards, view details, edit inline via modal and remove with confirmation.

- **Autocomplete:** suggestions for Subjects, Lecturers, Colleges, Halls and Groups derived from existing entries.
- **Countdown Timers:** per-lecture countdowns / status badges (safe / soon / urgent / in-progress).
- **Drag & Drop (cards are draggable):** lecture cards set as draggable to support moving/reordering (UI prepared for drag interactions).
- **FAB (Floating Action Button):** quick access to import / export / language actions.
- **Theming:** light / dark toggle implemented via CSS custom properties.
- **Bilingual UI (EN / AR):** built-in translation object and runtime switching.

## üìñ Usage (Quick Guide)

- **View details:** Click any lecture card to open a detail modal with all info and options (Copy, Edit, Delete).
- **Edit:** In the details modal, click **Edit** to switch to form mode; use Enter to navigate fields; save to apply.
- **Delete:** Delete is protected by a confirmation dialog.
- **Import / Export:** Use the FAB to import a `.json` backup or open the Export modal to generate a backup file. Imports show a confirmation with lecture count before replacing current data.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Data Management
Open Settings via the gear icon to:
- Change the application title (English & Arabic).
- Manage autocomplete lists (Subjects, Lecturers, Colleges, Halls, Groups) ‚Äî add/remove entries used across the UI.

## Accessibility & Keyboard Notes
- The forms support keyboard navigation; pressing **Enter** moves to the next input and submits on the last field.
- Modals use clear controls and focusable buttons; close them with the provided close buttons or by clicking outside.

## Contributing
Contributions, improvements and bug fixes are welcome. Suggested workflow:
1. Fork the repository.  
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-change`.  
3. Commit changes with clear messages.  
4. Open a Pull Request describing your change.

If you add features, please keep them framework-free (Vanilla JS + CSS) to remain consistent with the project's learning goals.

## Licence
This project is released under the **MIT Licence** ‚Äî feel free to use, adapt and share. (Add a `LICENSE` file with the MIT text when you publish.)

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Import fails / ‚ÄúInvalid file format‚Äù:** Ensure the JSON backup has a top-level `schedule` object and `settings` (exported using the app). The app validates and will show a friendly error if the file is malformed.
- **Export disabled:** If there are no lectures, the export action is disabled and the UI will prompt you that there‚Äôs nothing to export.

---

## Notes For Maintainers (Technical)
- The JS is wrapped in an IIFE to avoid polluting the global scope; the canonical days order is: `['saturday','sunday','monday','tuesday','wednesday','thursday','friday']`. State normalisation protects against malformed imports.
- Styles are driven by CSS variables so new theme colours or tweaks are straightforward.
