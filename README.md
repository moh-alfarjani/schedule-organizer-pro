# schedule-organizer-pro
A polished, single-page web application for managing weekly schedules â€” built from the ground up with HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox &amp; Grid) and Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). Clean UI, bilingual support (English / Arabic), local persistence, import/export and a set of thoughtful micro-interactions make this a reliable personal timetable tool.
